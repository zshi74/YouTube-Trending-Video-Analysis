**Statistical analysis on YouTube trending videos**

> September, 2019

Often times, when I’m browsing on Youtube, I’m always wondering why those videos can jump to the trending list. There is a pretty handy and complex algorithm behind the scene.

However, for this analysis, I will focus on using *statistical methods* to solve three problems:

* Should YouTubers publish their videos on weekend or weekdays?

* Whether getting into trending requires same amount of views among different groups? or are they different?

* Is there a relationship between views and number of tags when a video goes on trending?

This is the first time I started using statistics knowledge in R to analyze problems. I hope you enjoy reading and have fun with this analysis.
